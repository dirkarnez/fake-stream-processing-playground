=================================
### TODOs
- [ ] **Add support to loop intervals**
  - based on input file's sample rate
  - fake a hard loop intervals (real-time system)
  - allowing adjustments (sometime faster)
  - unconstant interval (e.g. undeterministic / noisy system)
- [ ] May be useless: Simulate interrupt (use multi-threading)

### What to do
- Mel-Spectrogram, MFCC
